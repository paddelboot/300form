 * Example page for the 300form validation class.
 * 
 * Copy this to your theme's main folder and select
 * it as page template in your page editor.
 * 
 * 
 * What are dynamic forms?
 * 
 * By "dynamic forms" I mean forms
 * that can contain a different number of form fields by each form call. 
 * Let's say you have a cart page that includes some products, and
 * these products are displayed within an order form. Since you
 * do not know the number of products in advance (and therefore don't know 
 * the exact number of fields your form will have), you will
 * need to set the "required" and "pattern" rules in the way described below.
 * 
 * ** IMPORTANT** 
 * All dynamicaly generated fields names must start with 'dyn-', i.e. 'dyn-name-13'
 * 
 * 
 * Patterns:
 * 
 * These require the use of regular expressions. If you don't know
 * how to write these, you can still help yourself with a 
 * regex library, such as http://regexlib.com
 * 
 *
